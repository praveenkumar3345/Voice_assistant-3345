Voice assistants are virtual companions that enable seamless interaction between humans and machines through spoken commands. By converting speech into digital instructions, they execute tasks without the need for manual input, offering convenience and accessibility.

With simple commands like "Hey Siri," "OK Google," or "Alexa," users can activate these assistants to perform various functions, such as checking the weather, sending messages, setting reminders, or playing music. Designed to understand natural language, they make communication intuitive and user-friendly, bridging the gap between technology and everyday life.
